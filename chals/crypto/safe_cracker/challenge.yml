  RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that involves the use of a public and private key. 
  The public key can be used to encrypt plaintext messages and is made widely available.
  The private key is used by the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext and is kept a secret. 

  How keys are generated: 
  1. Two large prime numbers, p and q, are generated.
  2. The public key consists of n, which calculated by multipling p and q, and e (which is typically set to 65537).
  3. The private key contains the modulus n and d, a private exponent. 
  4. The private exponent d is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)x(q-1).

  We found an encrypted safe combination. There are apparently many valuable items such as an invisibility cloak, an Amazon giftcard, salmon, and so much more...
  Can you please help us recover the original combination? 
  Tip: Once you have the correct pass code, submit it to safe.py to retrieve the flag.

hints:
  - We need to execute a certain type of a md5 hash collision attack.
  - Look for a tool to pull off a "md5 same prefix hash collision" attack.
  - Use [HashClash](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/hashclash)
