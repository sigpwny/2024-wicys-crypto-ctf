  I just learned about this cool new encryption scheme called Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It's so powerful, it doesn't matter how I use it!

hints:
  - You have full control over the curve parameters, can we use that to our advantage?
  - What does a bad curve look like?
  - Try setting 'nbits' to a small value (e.g. 5) so you can work out the math by hand.
