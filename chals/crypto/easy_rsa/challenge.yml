  RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that involves the use of a public and private key. 
  The public key can be used to encrypt plaintext messages and is made widely available.
  The private key is used by the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext and is kept a secret. 

  How keys are generated: 
  1. Two large prime numbers, p and q, are generated.
  2. The public key consists of n, which calculated by multipling p and q, and e (which is typically set to 65537).
  3. The private key contains the modulus n and d, a private exponent. 
  4. The private exponent d is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)x(q-1).

  You're given n and e - can you use that information to decrypt c?
