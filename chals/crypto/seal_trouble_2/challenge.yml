  The seal has gotten smarter and decided to not hide his passphrase in a photo of himself. However, he forgot what it was. :(
  He remembers that his passphrase is five characters and is comprised only of lowercase alphabetical letters. 
  Can you help us recover his passphrase and use that to decrypt the message?
