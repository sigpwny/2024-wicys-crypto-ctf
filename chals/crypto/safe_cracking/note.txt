Hints to help me remember the combination to my safe (since I always forget it):
Note that the answer to each problem corresponds to one part of the safe combination.

1. Anna and Beatrice perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange where p = 17 and g = 3. 
   Privately, Anna selects 5 and Beatrice chooses 11. What's their shared secret key?
2. The two perform another key exchange. Now, p = 157 and g = 2. 
   Anna's new private key is 67, while Beatrice's public key is 73. What is Anna's public key?
3. Anna forgot her private key and wants to solve for it. We know the following:
   a. Their shared secret key, s, is equal to 2417097.
   b. The values of p and g are 3042161 and 5, respectively.
   c. Beatrice's private key is 73.
